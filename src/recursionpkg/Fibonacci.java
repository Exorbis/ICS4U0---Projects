	You are to create a recursive (no loops) and an iterative (loops) version of the problem below
	
	The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, 
	and it happens to have a recursive definition. The first 
	two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). 
	Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, 
	so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. 
	Define calculate(n), and recursiveCalculate(n) methods that returns the nth fibonacci number, 
	with n=0 representing the start of the sequence. 

	calculate(0) -> 0
	calculate(1) -> 1
	calculate(2) -> 1
	
	recursiveCalculate(0) -> 0
	recursiveCalculate(1) -> 1
	recursiveCalculate(2) -> 1
